# Our problem statement 

The problem is to train a model to learn voice and accurately predict which class does this sound belong to . Our voice dataset consists of 10 different classes like , drilling , car horn , engine idiling , street music , dog bark , gun shot , jack hammer , siren , air conditioner , and children playing .  We used a Convolutional Neural Network approach as we convert the audio files to pictures by using melspectrogram function and  then use those images to train a CNN model . We got 89% accuracy . 
Then we use a artificial neural network approach and got 93% accuracy . After that , we combine those models and got 95% accuracy.
As for dataset :
that drive consists of all images that we generate from waves and datasets (we used only trainset as it has 5435 file labeled). In order to get all waves we create another folder and copy paste all waves in train and test folders that we get from archive .
