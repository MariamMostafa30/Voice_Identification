# Voice_Identification
# Our problem statement 
The problem is to train a model to learn voices and accurately predict who is speaking just by listening to their voices . Our voice dataset consists of 10 different classes like , drilling , car horn , engine idiling , street music , dog bark , gun shot , jack hammer , siren , air conditioner , and children playing .  We used a Convolutional Neural Network approach as we convert the audio files to pictures by using melspectrogram function and  then use those images to train a CNN model . We got 85% accuracy . 
As for dataset :
there is
